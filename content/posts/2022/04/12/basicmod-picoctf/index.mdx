Google's “20% Time”, inspired by Sergey Brin's and Larry Page's Montessori School experience, is a philosophy and policy that every Google employee spends 20% of their time (the equivalent of a full work day each week) working on ideas and projects that interest that employee. Ideas like Gmail, Google News, and AdSense have been developed from this working model. 

This website is a project I am working on in my senior English literature and composition course. During this project I will be spending 20% of my class time working on developing my idea through a progressive process to its final product. This website will be a space where I update visitors on the progress of my idea for this project. Thank you for visiting and I hope you follow along on my journey.

When you open the file, we are given a set of characters.

`91 322 57 124 40 406 272 147 239 285 353 272 77 110 296 262 299 323 255 337 150 102`

We are already given the steps to decode these integers. Mod 37, and then the definition of each integer. Lets make a script.

```python
enc = "91 322 57 124 40 406 272 147 239 285 353 272 77 110 296 262 299 323 255 337 150 102".split(" ") # Add each integer into an array
enc = [int(x) for x in enc] # Convert the array into a integer type
print(enc) # Sanity test
m = ""
import string
for i in enc:
for x, y in zip(range(0, 26), string.ascii_uppercase): # Loop through all uppercase ascii
    #print(x, y)
    z = i % 37 # Mod 37
	    if z == x: # If the uppercase ascii id is equal to the integer, then add to the final string
	        m += str(y)
	    if z > 25: # If larger, then make into ascii integer values and add to final string
	        w = z + 22
	        m += chr(w)
	        break
	        
	
	print("picoCTF{" + m.replace(":", "_") + "}") # Print in picoCTF format
	
	# 17 26 20 13 3 36 13 36 17 26 20 13 3 36 0 3 3 27 33 4 2 28
	# picoCTF{R0UND_N_R0UND_ADD17EC2}
```

In the competition, we got our final string.

> picoCTF{R0UND_N_R0UND_ADD17EC2}

Same things.

```python
enc = "104 290 356 313 262 337 354 229 146 297 118 373 221 359 338 321 288 79 214 277 131 190 377".split(" ") # Add each integer into an array
enc = [int(x) for x in enc] # Convert the array into a integer type
print(enc) # Sanity test
m = ""
import string
for i in enc:
for x, y in zip(range(1, 27), string.ascii_uppercase): # Loop through all uppercase ascii
    #print(x, y)
    z = i % 41 # Mod 37
	    if z == x: # If the uppercase ascii id is equal to the integer, then add to the final string
	        m += str(y)
	    if z > 26: # If larger, then make into ascii integer values and add to final string
	        w = z + 21
	        m += chr(w)
	        break
	        
	
	print("picoCTF{" + m + "}") # Print in picoCTF format
	
	# picoCTF{1nv3r53ly_h4rd_8a05d939}
```

This is the flag.
