Welcome to a new website! There are a lot more improvements on this site, and a new theme to follow. This is slightly based on Minh Duong's theme of gatsby, but customized it to my own.

As stated, this site was built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a static site generator based on the React framework. In other words, it's pretty fast.

This is the report Minh had, but the benefits of this site, also provides responsiveness on a whole new level!

This includes:
- Comment system using GitHub issues (utterances)
- Fancy animations/transitions while navigating
- MDX support for blog posts, like this one
- Support for clients without JavaScript
- A11Y friendly
- Dark mode :)

The source code for this site is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ZyphenSVC/zyphensvc.com)

## What's next?

Will be posting a bit more frequently on new and exciting projects I have to offer. This will of course have the occasional ctf writeup, but more so on projects!
