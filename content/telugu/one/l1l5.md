Currently, the verb To Be has been conjugated, but we haven't exactly learned the chart for conjugating verbs. We will learn this in a future lesson, but for now, current lessons will contain the raw form of the verb and will have a conjugated version below each sentence. These words will be coming from our word banks which are linked at the beginning of each lesson.

In a lot of Asian languages, there are things called particles. They are rarely present in Latin-Based languages, however, they are vital to these languages. Particles are parts of grammar that may add some vital understanding to the overall sentence. They are generally just sounds that are attached to a word that can change the meaning of the word. It could signify something is an object of the sentence or a syllable that indicates that it is a location where something is occurring at. These simply put are vital to the language. One such particle that we will look at is the Object Marking Particle.
