Hey, I am Sriaditya Vedantam, also known as Zyphen. Throughout the past couple of years I have built a up a profile named Zyphen. Currently I am a highschooler at Alliance Academy for Innovation. In my time at Alliance, I found a group of friends who are also Cyber Enthusiasts such as I, and are overall well versed in cybersecurity competitions also known as CTFs. We called the team Egg Heads. Through the years we have done many competitions, paid and free, competing against, and beating, many colleges and universities. I am still learning along the way and I hope my posts on CTFs or related improve overtime. In my freetime, I like to read or write, go out with friends, or workout. Hope you enjoy!
